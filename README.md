Open source protocol for forum post implementation

The general idea is to create a protocol that forums can implement. Then, other platforms (readers) can aggregate forum posts a user is interested in and seamlessly interact with the forum from the reader. This means that the forum might not get traffic, but it keeps the "old" kind of forum thread history in place. In a way, this would be quite similar to IRC, but just persisted.
